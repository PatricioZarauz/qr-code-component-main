## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned the usage of the following css attributes: `aspect-ratio` and `text-wrap`.

### Continued development

I would like to reach a "pixel perfect" design, without hardcoding measurements. Also maybe simplify the css or html if possible. Any suggestions are welcomed.
